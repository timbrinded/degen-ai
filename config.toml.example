# ============================================================================
# GOVERNANCE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# The governance system prevents "strategy thrash" by introducing multi-timescale
# decision-making, policy persistence, and change governance. It separates execution
# (fast loop), planning (medium loop), and regime detection (slow loop).

[governance]
# Fast loop: Deterministic execution following the active plan (no LLM queries)
# Recommended: 5-30 seconds for responsive execution
fast_loop_interval_seconds = 10

# Medium loop: Tactical planning and Strategy Plan Card maintenance (LLM queries)
# Recommended: 15-120 minutes for hobby trading, 5-30 minutes for active trading
medium_loop_interval_minutes = 30

# Slow loop: Regime detection and macro-level policy changes
# Recommended: 24 hours for hobby trading, 4-12 hours for active trading
slow_loop_interval_hours = 24

[governance.governor]
# Minimum advantage required over change cost (in basis points)
# This prevents unprofitable strategy switches. The expected advantage from a new
# strategy must exceed the switching cost by at least this amount.
# Recommended: 50-100 bps for conservative, 25-50 bps for aggressive
minimum_advantage_over_cost_bps = 50.0

# Cooldown period after plan changes (in minutes)
# Prevents rapid strategy flip-flopping by enforcing a minimum time between changes.
# Recommended: 60-120 minutes for hobby trading, 30-60 minutes for active trading
cooldown_after_change_minutes = 60

# Percentage of portfolio to rotate per medium loop cycle during rebalancing
# Gradual rebalancing reduces market impact and slippage. Lower values = slower rotation.
# Recommended: 25-50% for hobby trading, 10-25% for active trading
partial_rotation_pct_per_cycle = 25.0

# Path to persist governor state (relative to project root)

# Higher values require stronger evidence before switching regimes.
# Recommended: 0.6-0.8 for conservative, 0.5-0.6 for aggressive
hysteresis_enter_threshold = 0.7

# Confidence threshold to exit current regime (0.0-1.0)
# Lower than enter threshold creates hysteresis, preventing ping-ponging.
# Recommended: 0.3-0.5 (should be 0.2-0.3 below enter threshold)
hysteresis_exit_threshold = 0.4

# Hours before scheduled macro event to lock plan changes
# Prevents strategy changes immediately before high-impact events (FOMC, CPI, etc.)
# Recommended: 2-4 hours for conservative, 1-2 hours for aggressive
event_lock_window_hours_before = 2

# Hours after scheduled macro event to lock plan changes
# Allows volatility to settle before making strategy decisions.
# Recommended: 1-2 hours for conservative, 0.5-1 hour for aggressive

[governance.tripwire]
# Minimum margin ratio before triggering safety tripwire (0.0-1.0)
# Triggers when account margin falls below this level. Lower = more aggressive.
# Recommended: 0.15-0.25 for hobby trading (exchange minimum is typically 0.03-0.05)
min_margin_ratio = 0.15

# Proximity to liquidation price that triggers warning (0.0-1.0)
# Triggers when position is within this percentage of liquidation price.
# Recommended: 0.20-0.30 for conservative, 0.15-0.20 for aggressive
liquidation_proximity_threshold = 0.25

# Maximum daily loss percentage before cutting positions (0.0-100.0)
# Absolute safety limit - cuts positions when daily loss exceeds this percentage.
# Recommended: 3-5% for hobby trading, 5-10% for active trading
daily_loss_limit_pct = 5.0

# Maximum seconds of data staleness before freezing new risk
# Prevents trading on stale data when API is slow or unresponsive.
# Recommended: 300-600 seconds (5-10 minutes)
max_data_staleness_seconds = 300

# Maximum consecutive API failures before triggering operational tripwire
# Freezes new risk when API becomes unreliable.
# Recommended: 3-5 failures for conservative, 5-10 for aggressive
